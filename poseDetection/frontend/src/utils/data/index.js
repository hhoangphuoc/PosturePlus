If your left leg is your standing leg, keep your left foot planted on the ground, and slowly bend in your right leg at the right knee so that the sole of your right foot rests against your left inner thigh (known as the half-lotus position in Bikram yoga). Point the knee of your bent leg outward, away from your body.',
        'Lengthen your body. Clasp your hands together in Anjali Mudra (also called the “prayer position”)',

        'Firm the shoulder blades against the back, puffing the side ribs forward. Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back. Distribute the backbend evenly throughout the entire spine.',    
        'Hold the pose anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds, breathing easily. Release back to the floor with an exhalation.',

        'Straighten through your left leg, then hinge and reach your torso over your left leg as your hips jut back. Rotate your left palm so it faces the ceiling, and gaze out over your left arm.',
        'Maintain a long, straight spine as you reach your left hand to the mat, placing it in front of your left foot. If you feel off balance, bring in your back leg closer to shorten your stance. Gaze towards your right arm, which should be extended overhead. Hold and repeat on the other side.',

        'Lift your hips off of the mat coming into bridge pose and extend your arms onto the ground, palms facing down as if your hands could touch your heels.

Bend at the elbows, place your hands on your low back creating a shelf, and then extend the next leg up.',
        "Once you raise the legs, don't turn your head to the side to look around the room, since you can injure your neck. Keep your gaze upward and your neck straight.",
        "Lift up through the balls of your feet. Walk your hands further up the back for more stability. Feel the chest reaching towards the chin to support opening the upper back.",
        "Move your hips toward the front of the room and your feet toward the back of the room to straighten the body. The correct alignment is with the hips over the shoulders and feet over the hips. Ask your teacher or a friend to help you determine if your legs are perpendicular to the floor.",
        "Stay in the pose for up to 10 breaths",
